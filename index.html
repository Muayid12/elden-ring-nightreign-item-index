The secluded forest was being eaten away by the surrounding desert, and when the blessing of water passed over its many leaves and boughs, thus began a great exodus of its creatures. To survive, the insects would have to adapt. So began their prolonged and perilous journey.</td></tr>

Indeed, it had been roused from its aimless life of floating, camouflaged within its surroundings. The strange taste of this night was all too lonely, and more vast than it could ever know.</td></tr>

The demon was obsessed with the concepts of impartiality, fairness, and equanimity. For anything to reach a higher plane each side must elevate the other. The goat-eyed being gazed into the darkness. If it is true, that the night swallows all, then the night is impartial. The night is a thing of fairness, of equanimity. The night is a champion of balance.</td></tr>

From the phantasmal peak upon which she hid herself, she peered down into the world, committing to memory what she perceived. Then, her eye drawn to a certain cataclysm, from out of hiding she leapt with wings unfurled.

<tr><td>00000834</td><td>Night of the Lord</td><td>The night belonging to Heolstor, left upon its defeat. The power of its namesake can be unlocked by performing a relic rite. The country lay in ruin. The man who once was knight had challenged the hero, but he too was no match. He fell, just another body in a great pile. But eventually he awoke, crawling out from underneath the others. Though he had failed to protect anything or anyone, he yet lived. And so he cursed the world. It was the dead of night, and from the sky poured down a great rain.</td></tr>
<tr><td>00002710</td><td>Old Pocketwatch</td><td>A well-kept antique pocketwatch engraved with an intricate design, likely a prized possession. The influence of the encroaching Night clung to the expecting woman, preventing her from ever giving birth. The only means to break it meant the sacrifice of her life. But the curse of Night lived on, in both the orphan and in this keepsake, whose hands tell only twisted time. This dark power is both a badge of lost innocence, and the very thing that allows its owner to fight back.</td></tr>
<tr><td>00002711</td><td>Besmirched Frame</td><td>A small frame that is missing its picture. Whatever precious memory it once enshrined, now is home only to dust and grime. A voice is heard that beckons one to seek the owner. "Peer into this window, and revisit the first glimpse of night..."</td></tr>
<tr><td>00002712</td><td>Fell Omen Fetish</td><td>A fetish bathed in golden magic. Shackles were used to bind the accursed people called the Omen, and these ones were made to keep a particular Omen under strictest confinement. But the magic has long faded, leaving only a dark stain in its wake. The protector of gold yet stands guard over the realm, even after being swallowed by Night.</td></tr>
<tr><td>00002AF8</td><td>Slate Whetstone</td><td>A natural whetstone of high quality with a fine grain. A precious sharpening stone mined in Limveld. The clash with Night has spanned eons. And yet now, precious little time remains.</td></tr>
<tr><td>00002AF9</td><td>The Wylder's Earring</td><td>A single earring belonging to the Wylder. Rusted and encrusted with grime. Such ornaments were worn for generations by a distant tribe. They are delicately embellished to cast a pattern when held up to light. A relic of the Lord who lumbered ever onward, clutching tight this single ornament.</td></tr>

<tr><td>00002EE0</td><td>Third Volume</td><td>Annals detailing the histories of certain cursed weapons speak of a conflict far to the west. An account mentions one such accursed weapon called an Ictarus. "The blades shared an identical engraving. A symbol of the sorcery of a distant land. A script put down in blood."</td></tr>
<tr><td>00002EE1</td><td>Stone Stake</td><td>A stone stake that opens a sealed-away lock. Crafted by an ancient civilization and claimed from a Guardian Golem. Still imbued with an old yet fading magic. Can open locks sealed in a similar manner to the golem.</td></tr>
<tr><td>00002EE2</td><td>Witch's Brooch</td><td>A brooch imbued with potent magic, made from the blood magic crystal received from the Recluse. This brooch powered the accursed Ictarus weapons that once robbed the Pinionfolk of flight. At first, this magic brooch, with its aura of unknowable power, was intended as a ceremonial tool to calm violent winds. But the war, for better or worse, demanded that it be employed otherwise, as a magic artifact to bring a swift end to the conflict.</td></tr>
<tr><td>00002EE3</td><td>Cracked Witch's Brooch</td><td>A cracked brooch, bereft of its former magic. A blood magic crystal received from the Recluse. This brooch powered the accursed Ictarus weapons that once robbed the Pinionfolk of flight. The Guardian smashed the jewel at the core of this magic implement. To think it was once a mere ceremonial tool to calm violent winds.</td></tr>

<tr><td>000032C8</td><td>Fine Arrowhead</td><td>A finely-crafted streamlined arrowhead. Used by sellswords of the Fellowship. Said to be the choice weapon of the Monster, an inhuman assassin. A single word is written on each arrow, and when an arrow deals a death blow, the word becomes the epitaph of the fallen. To this day, the Monster lurks somewhere, unseen and unknown.</td></tr>
<tr><td>000032C9</td><td>Cracked Sealing Wax</td><td>Sealing wax removed from an opened letter. Used by sellswords of the Fellowship. The stamp signifies an assassin's oath. Once a target is agreed upon, there is no going back. Such contracts are said to have their origin in the Lands Between.</td></tr>
<tr><td>000032CA</td><td>Edge of Order</td><td>A fragment of the spear of Fulghor, Champion of Nightglow. Imbued with holy essence through battles in Limveld. Can briefly, and only with very limited potency, grant its power to other armaments. When Those Who Live in Death are felled by the Order, they will never rise again.</td></tr>
<tr><td>000036B0</td><td>Golden Dew</td><td>Liquid plant extract that is highly effective at repairing armaments. Harvested in indeterminate locations across the Lands Between, but only by those who are aware of its useful properties. This viscous oil can be extracted by squeezing the flower, seeds and all. Some call the liquid golden dew, owing to its lustrous yellow hue.</td></tr>
<tr><td>000036B1</td><td>Crown Medal</td><td>A medal adorning a doll resembling a young girl. An extra decoration for the Revenant's garb. The silver shines with a brilliance that is both ceremonial and dignified. It recalls the girl's words. "With strength comes the burden of duty."</td></tr>
<tr><td>000036B2</td><td>Blessed Iron Coin</td><td>An iron coin imbued with a small blessing by the priestess. Emits a faint warmth. The girl made a wish to the mechanical doll... That a blessing would reach himâ€”a blessing that could open the eyes of one who is already dead but refuses to accept it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>00003A98</td><td>Torn Braided Cord</td><td>A torn magic-warding braided cord. Worn by warriors for good luck on the eve of battle. The distinctive stone clasp suggests that it belonged to glory-seeking pirates. The legends surrounding the competing seafaring factions, who divided the seas into east and west, have been spoken of for generations in places near and far.</td></tr>
<tr><td>00003A9A</td><td>Black Claw Necklace</td><td>A necklace made from a thick rugged claw, with a shining black luster that instils fear in any who gaze upon it. Long ago, the Raider fought the king of the archipelago forest. He grappled the hulking beast with his iron grip, and flung him away, proving his strength. He claimed the king's broken claw as a trophy and testament to his victory. For a time, the Raider devoted himself to exploits on the high seas, but he tired of the unending struggle that never seemed to determine a clear victor. And so, he delivered the claw to his arch nemesis as an invitation to duel to the death.</td></tr>
<tr><td>00003E80</td><td>Blade of Night Fragment</td><td>A blade fragment imbued with the power of Night. Crystals have formed on the broken edge. The dark substance slowly spread, as if to restore the lost portion of the blade, or to sharpen the existing blade beyond its natural properties.</td></tr>
<tr><td>00003E81</td><td>Small Makeup Brush</td><td>Tool for accentuating the beauty of people and things. One of the Iron Menial's favorite items. Though plain it is a reliable tool, with a soft-bristled brush that delicately applies ceruse to skin or other surfaces. "Your beauty deserves nothing less."</td></tr>
<tr><td>00003E82</td><td>Old Portrait</td><td>An intricate painting of a girl of pure heart and an elderly companion that conveys both trust and affection. On that night, the doll understoodâ€”the young girl wished to live. And with that understanding, the doll found her purpose. On the back of the painting is a hurriedly scrawled, fading message. "Chloe, seek happiness, for you deserve it more than anyone."</td></tr>
<tr><td>00004268</td><td>Night Shard</td><td>A crystallized form of the power of Night. A strange, translucent thing with a corrosive shadow that appears to writhe. The reach of the Night is limitless; its potential, immeasurable. Its touch indiscriminate, affecting any and all things. Whether one fears the Night, or welcomes it, depends upon the manner of contact. But as for the Night, here and now, it is the unquestioned enemy of the Condemned.</td></tr>
<tr><td>00004269</td><td>Vestige of Night</td><td>A clear sign of the Nightlord's presence, in the form of a terribly tattered rag. Burned and worn down over a span of time untold, the hint of an impression once made by the engraving of an old sealing stone can be seen, but it is no longer legible. The menial asked about an engraving. But how did he know there was one, before setting eyes upon it?</td></tr>
<tr><td>0000426A</td><td>Bone-Like Stone</td><td>A disturbing stone with a distinct lifelessness. The bone of an outer god with the power to expunge divine essence, but that can also be destroyed by the same essence. The choice was left to the witch. As per the wishes of the one who bestowed it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>00004650</td><td>Blessed Flowers</td><td>Altus flowers flush with nutrients and grace. Before, such flowers were commonplace on the Altus Plateau. The vibrant hues suggest that the flowers received plenty of sunlight, and appear to shine in an ode to the resplendent Erdtree.</td></tr>
<tr><td>00004651</td><td>Golden Shell</td><td>A golden seed that has exhausted its grace. Such seeds were once found at the base of illusory trees. The seed was sapped of its grace by the priestess, but not entirely. Although very little remains, its grace will one day return, like trees that grow back in a celebration of life.</td></tr>
<tr><td>00004652</td><td>Golden Sprout</td><td>A golden seed harboring a warm blessing. This one was found on a steep and snowy peak. This seed sprouted despite the harshness of its environment, like youthful potential blossoming in the crucible of adversity. Or, what may be called a miracle.</td></tr>

But not being one for regrets, the first mate was unperturbed by what others said. Going by the self-appointed title of "apprentice of a great pirate," Weathervane found that dreams could come true, even if they might take a lifetime. No wonder she so cherished the wind.</td></tr>

Burned and worn down over a span of time untold, the hint of an impression once made by the engraving of an old sealing stone can be seen, but it is no longer legible. And yet a lingering magic recalls something familiar. As if the impressed seal is being held intact by someone in mortal fear of the light's annulment.</td></tr>

<tr><td>000F4258</td><td>Black Claw Necklace</td><td>Necklace made from a thick rugged claw A necklace made from a thick rugged claw, with a shining black luster that instils fear in any who gaze upon it. Long ago, the Raider fought the king of the archipelago forest. He grappled the hulking beast with his iron grip, and flung him away, proving his strength. He claimed the king's broken claw as a trophy and testament to his victory. For a time, the Raider devoted himself to exploits on the high seas, but he tired of the unending struggle that never seemed to determine a clear victor. And so, he delivered the claw to his arch nemesis as an invitation to duel to the death.</td></tr>
<tr><td>000F4259</td><td>Double Sided Coin</td><td>A coin given by an all-or-nothing pirate A coin from a former age received from a burly man. Treasure chests, brimming with such coins, are the stuff of pirates' dreams. Originally minted with imprints on both sides, the ornamentation has long since vanished owing to the covetous rubbing of thick-knuckled fingers. The coin recalls the man's worldly wisdom. "It's your journey. Take all the paths you like."</td></tr>
<tr><td>000F425A</td><td>Crown Medal</td><td>A medal adorning a doll resembling a young girl A medal adorning a doll resembling a young girl. An extra decoration for the Revenant's garb.

"Two seafarers, one from the west and the other from the east, were once locked in a fierce competition for influence. The White Horn ruled the west waters, while the Black Claw presided over the eastern seas. Upon the shore did they contend for seven days and seven nights to see which was the stronger. While each fought bravely, a clear victor felt undeterminable."</td></tr>
<tr><td>000F425F</td><td>Blessed Iron Coin</td><td>An iron coin imbued with a small blessing An iron coin imbued with a small blessing by the priestess. Emits a faint warmth. The blessing would surely become a beacon to guide its bearer to its former owner. That it might save the dear brother who would be facing death in the world outside. With that wish, so was it endowed. To one who could not be said to be truly alive, but all the same was surely called a friend.</td></tr>

A fine work of craft made by Gillian, the Duchess' steward and de facto patron. The Duchess once lived under the Viscount's roof, where she applied herself as a virtuous thief. She locked the tools of her trade inside a box of prized possessions, which she hid in a dim cellar. This practice has not changed since coming to the Roundtable Hold. She yet keeps her secrets safe from prying eyes, concealing them in darkened corners.</td></tr>

The passage, torn from its former binding, reads: "The Priestess is the very cornerstone of the Roundtableâ€”indispensable. Should the Nightlord fall, the Roundtable too will crumble, as their fates are together bound. Yet should the Roundtable be remade, perhaps the Priestess may be emancipated from her bindings. This might be done upon the falling of the "New Night," should the Lord's power be lost. And if so..."</td></tr>
